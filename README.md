# **Time-Series Analysis with Python - Statistics, Predictions and GUIs**

#### by SÃ©rgio Pereira, April 2022
Graphical User Interfaces for Time-Series Analysis (including Descriptive Statistics, Spectral Analysis and Predictive modelling with different models) 

A time-series is used in this project to code in python and explore a comprehensive set of statistical analysis, modeling, and prediction tools. These, combined with Interactive GUIs, allow the user to perform different actions on the data. For example, the user can select time periods or specific days and statistical parameters are computed and visualized; in the predictive models changes in hyperparameters are shown in the prediction curve plotted.

This notebook is expected to have some regular development at least for two reasons: (i) because the topic of time series is interesting and important in so many fields; (ii) this kind of notebook, with interactive widgets, convinced me on the interest of these kind of GUIs for educational purposes in mathematics, statistics, programming, or science in general. A time-series is a sequence of measurements from a system that varies in time. Usually, these information points are collected at adjacent time-spaces, thus there is a relation between observations, proportional or not. This is a characteristic of time-series that differentiates them from other data. For coding purposes, a time-series is a set of data indexed by time. Use case: Hourly data of Black Carbon (BC) mass concentration measurements from a small city (60000 in) are used throughout this notebook. Thus, this is a univariate time series, a sequence of measurements of the same variable. BC aerosols emerge in the atmosphere mainly produced by anthropogenic activities, with vehicles, industry, and biomass burning being the most important sources. Section 1 deals essentially with descriptive statistics and main features of the data; in section 2 some further analysis is made, including the time-series autocorrelation and stationarity. Section 3 introduces the frequency domain with spectral analysis and shows some features of Fourier analysis. Section 4 brings machine learning techniques, and different predictive models are implemented and applied in the time-series.
